# QE Redistribution ML
## Analyzing the Redistribution Effects of Quantitative Easing Using Machine Learning

### 📌 Project Overview
This project applies **Causal ML, Generative AI (GANs, VAEs), and Reinforcement Learning** to examine 
whether **redistribution among households with different portfolios amplifies or dampens QE effects.**

### 📁 Repository Structure:
- `data/raw/` → Raw SCF & macroeconomic datasets (not included in GitHub)
- `data/processed/` → Cleaned & transformed datasets for analysis
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis, ML models, and causal inference
- `src/` → Python scripts for machine learning, reinforcement learning, and data processing
- `models/` → Trained machine learning models
- `reports/` → Research findings, graphs, and paper drafts

### 📥 How to Download SCF Data:
1. Go to the **Federal Reserve SCF website**: [SCF Data Download](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm)
2. Download the following files:
   - **Main Survey Data (`.dta`)**
   - **Replicate Weight File (`.dta`)**
